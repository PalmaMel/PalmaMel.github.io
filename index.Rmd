## About Me

Hi, i am a 20 year old undergraduate student of the Genomic Sciences program of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I don’t have a defined research topic yet, so I’m still open to new opportunities. However, I would like to improve my programming skills.

I really enjoy drawing and singing, but usually you may find me reading fiction or hanging out with my family and pets.
